# Classification Modeling Project

This project applies machine learning classification techniques to predict outcomes from a chosen dataset.

The goal is to explore data, train multiple models, and identify the one that best balances accuracy and interpretability.

Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and feature engineering were performed to prepare the dataset.

Three models—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—were trained and evaluated on the same data split.

Model performance was compared using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

The best-performing model was selected based on evaluation results and business relevance.

Key insights highlight factors influencing predictions and guide data-driven decisions.

Future improvements include adding more data and testing advanced algorithms.
